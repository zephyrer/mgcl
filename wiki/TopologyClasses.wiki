== Summary ==
`MGTopology` is an abstract base class of class `MGCellBase` and class `MGComplex`.

http://mgcl.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/image/mg-topology.png

`MGTopology`:

  `MGTopology` is an abstract class that represents all of the topological structures.

`MGCellBase`:

  `MGCellBase` is the base class of whole Cell. 
  `MGCellBase` holds only the binder Cell pointer (if a Cell belongs to a partnership) that represents the partner relationship. 
  `MGCellBase` is a super class of classes `MGPVertex` and `MGCellNB`.

`MGPVertex`:

  `MGPVertex` is a special Cell that is a parameter Cell and also a boundary of an Edge simultaneously. 
  `MGPVertex` is a subclass of `MGCellBase`.

  As member data, `MGPVertex` holds a parameter value of an `MGEdge` (of a curve that is a geometry of the Edge)
  and the Edge pointer that is the star Cell of the `MGPVertex`. 
  The parameter value is an information of class parameter Cell, 
  and the Edge pointer is an information of ordinal class Boundary's star Cell pointer.

  `MGPVertex` cannot be a binder Cell, can be only a parameter Cell. 
  Binder Cell of an `MGPVertex` is `MGBVertex`.

`MGCellNB`:

  `MGCellNB` represents the theoretical Cell structures without boundary data out of whole Cell information, 
  is a subclass of `MGCellBase`. Only an instance of class `MGCellNB` (or its subclasses) can be a member Cell of an `MGComplex`. 
  Also, only an instance of class `MGCellNB` can be a binder Cell. 
  `MGCellNB` is the super class of classes `MGBVertex`, `MGEdge`, and `MGCell`.

  As member data, `MGCellNB` has [GeometryClasses geometry] (Cell's extent), 
  the parent Complex pointer (if the `MGCellNB` is a member Cell of an `MGComplex`), 
  and partner member Cells (if the `MGCellNB` is a binder Cell).

`MGBVertex`:

  `MGBVertex` is 0D manifold (point), 
  has no boundaries, 
  and is a binder Cell version of an `MGPVertex`. 
  `MGBVertex` has no member data. 
  The information of the super class `MGCellNB` suffices.

`MGEdge`:

  `MGEdge` is 1D manifold (line), does not have any general Boundary, 
  but has instances of class `MGPVertex` as the boundary data. 
  An array of two instances of class `MGPVertex` (start and end point) is the member data.
  An instance of `MGEdge` can be either a parameter Cell or a binder Cell.

`MGCell`:

  `MGCell` is an abstract class that represents manifolds whose dimensions are 2 or more than 2. 
  Face, solid, or greater manifold dimension's objects are the examples. 

  As a member data, Cell has array of Boundaries. 
  The first one in the array is the outer boundary of the star Cell (if an outer boundary exists), 
  and other boundaries are inner boundaries. 
  We allow inactive boundaries are included in a Cell.

  Cell can be either a parameter Cell or a binder Cell.

`MGFace`:

  `MGFace` is a class of 2D manifold, whose boundary is loop. 
  `MGFace` is a subclass of class `MGCell`. 
  Class `MGFace` is a constituent of class `MGShell`.

`MGComplex`:

  `MGComplex` is two ordered sets of `MGCell`s, 
  which are a set of parameter Cells and a set of binder Cells. 
  Cells of different manifold dimensions may be members of a Complex. 
  Thus a Complex can express so-called nonmanifold models. 
  Geometries of all member Cells of a Complex, either binder Cells or parameter Cells, 
  have the same world space coordinates, 
  which may have different manifold dimensions. 
  When a Complex is to express a body in our ordinal world, all Cells included in the body Complex have ordinal world coordinates of the body. 
  When a Complex is to express a boundary of a Cell, all Cells included in the Complex have the star Cell's parameter space coordinates.

  `MGComplex` is a super class of `MGBoundary` class that is a boundary expression of `MGCell`. 
  `MGComplex` does not have [GeometryClasses geometry] data as a member data, but `MGCell` has.

`MGBoundarynD`:

  Boundary is an ordered set of same manifold dimension Cells, all of which must be orientable. 
  An instance of class `MGBoundarynD` must not intersect with itself. 
  Boundary class is a special Complex class, that is, is a subclass of Complex whose Cells all have the same manifold dimension. 
  Boundary is a boundary of the star Cell. 
  The manifold dimension is lower by one than that of the star Cell.

`MGLoop`:

  Loop is an ordered set of edges (parameter Cells), and is a boundary of a face. 
  `MGLoop` is a subclass of class `MGBoundary`.
  An edge in a Loop is connected to at most one neighbor edge before and after the edge. 
  When the start point of the first edge is connected to the end point of the last edge, 
  the loop is closed, and is homeomorphic to a circle (that is a unit circle S^1). 
  Coordinate data of edges in a loop that is a boundary of a face is the face's parameter `(u, v)`.

`MGShell`:

  Shell is an ordered set of Faces, which are connected each other through a binder Edge at their parameter Edge. 
  Shell makes a boundary of a solid, and is a subclass of class Boundary.

`Star`:

  自身が境界 (の一部) となっている 1 (以上) 高い多様体次元のセル。

`Boundary`:

  あるセルの境界を構成するセル群 (Complex)。

  通常のモデルでは star/boudary は 1 だけ高い、または低い多様体次元のセルを求める。
  Boundary はあるセルの境界を構成するセル群 (Complex) である。

  図では C11 の star Cell は face1 であり、
  face1 の boundary は C10, C11, C12, C13 である。

`Neighbour`:

  隣接セル、すなわち同一セルの境界となっている隣の境界である。

  隣接 (neighbour) とは、同じセル (一つ多様体次元が高い) の境界を構成するセルで、
  自身のセルに隣接するものである。
  
  図では C11 の neighbour は C10, C12 である。

`Partner`:

  パートナー (partner) とは自身のセルのとは異なるセルの境界を表現していて、
  自身のセルと binder を通して接続されている。

  図では C11 の partner は C2 である。
  binder B1 を通して接続されている。
